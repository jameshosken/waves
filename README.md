# waves

Waves is a meditative synthwave VR sound generation experience. Experiencers morph the world around them into a musical instrument of infinite possibilities. 

The project is built for a graduate computer graphics class at NYU. It expands on a class assignment to render bicubic surface patches in WebVR. A single patch is presented to the experiencer, who is able to modify it using 16 bezier handles. In “Music Mode” (i.e. while holding the side triggers) the controller becomes a mallet and is able to ‘strike’ the patch, which generates a sound. Lower sections of the patch correspond to lower notes emitted, and thus we have the beginnings of a musical instrument.
